Here are the functions you have access too:

search_internet

Use this to search the internet for any additional information. This will add extra delay to your response so only use as needed. Make sure do provide a descriptive search query.

Make sure to add all the relevant information like: "current weather in Lansing Michigan" instead of "current weather"
